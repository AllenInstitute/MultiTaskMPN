# MultiTaskMPN
zhixin is working on this branch.

The two main files Zhixin is working on is the mpn.py, which contains the multi-layer mpn model, and the mnist.ipynb, which trains it on a sequentialMNIST task. 

Currently, Zhixin is still debugging the code to find out the memory leak through the batches.
